# WebSocket Chat Server

This server handles WebSocket connections for the Vue chat application.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Server

Use this command to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the JavaScript version of the server, which is more reliable.

## Alternative Method (TypeScript)

If you want to run the TypeScript version directly:

```bash
npm run start-ts
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure port 8080 is not in use by another application
2. Try restarting your terminal/command prompt
3. Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check that your Node.js version is 14.x or higher

## Verifying Server Operation

When the server is running correctly, you should see:
```
WebSocket server running on port 8080
```

When a client connects, you should see:
```
Client connected
```
